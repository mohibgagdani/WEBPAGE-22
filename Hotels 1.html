        The 8 Best Hotels In The <br>
        World, According Tobr <br>
        Tripadvisor Travelers’ Choice <br>
        Awards
    </font>

    <font size="5" color="#164880">
        Travelers from around the world have decided on their favorite hotels for 2024, and <b>Tripadvisor</b> has
        unveiled
        the final
        results of winners for its annual Travelers’ Choice Best of the Best Hotels Awards. The awards celebrate
        this year’s
        highest-rated hotels based on Tripadvisor reviews.
        <br><br>
        Deep in the heart of Brazil is the number one hotel, <b>Hotel Colline de France.</b> This French-inspired,
        34-suite
        boutique
        hotel is located in the mountain town of Gramado. The property has the most 5-star reviews of any other
        listing on the
        site. Many travelers note the service and attention “I was greeted with warm smiles and impeccable service,”
        says one
        5-star reviewer, another says, “This is a fairy tale not a hotel. Elegant, charming and everything is close
        to
        perfection.”
        <br><br>
        The <b>Shore Hotel</b> is the No. 1 hotel in the United States. The eco-friendly boutique property is located in
        Santa
        Monica,
        Calif., and offers stunning ocean views. Guests love the contemporary property and the personal attention from
        the
        staff. Reviewers are enthusiastic about the property saying, “By far the best service we have had at a hotel,”
        and “The
        staff pampered us and made sure every minute of our stay was handled with care.”
        <br><br>
        While travelers are often very opinionated on their favorite properties, it is essential to note that most of
        the
        winning hotels this year highlight enhanced customer service and staff that go out of their way to impress their
        guests.
        The range of properties is extensive, with Vietnam, Maldives, and Mexico leading the pack with two properties
        each. In
        the U.S., New York City and San Antonio, Texas, have the most star-reviewed hotels. Some hotels are
        all-inclusive and
        family-friendly, while others are purely for adults-only.
